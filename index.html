                    <p>
                        <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> is a British computer scientist born on June 8, 1955, in London. He is best known for inventing the World Wide Web while working at CERN in 1989. His creation of the web provided a way to access and share information through interconnected documents over the Internet. Berners-Lee developed the first web browser and server software, and the first website went live in 1991. His work has profoundly influenced modern technology and communication. He is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and continues to advocate for an open and accessible web. Berners-Lee has received numerous accolades for his contributions, including being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and winning the Turing Award.
